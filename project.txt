I was tasked with analyzing environmental data using Python and MySQL for monitoring and analysis purposes. The project involved working with a real-world database and extracting valuable information from the dataset.

My responsibilities included preprocessing the data, handling null values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types for optimal analysis. Additionally, I needed to develop an algorithm to identify and count null values in each column. Using SQL concepts, I was expected to aggregate, group, and order the data to solve specific problems and uncover insights.

To meet these requirements, I utilized Python programming language and MySQL database. I wrote code to preprocess the data, remove duplicates, and handle null values. I created a dictionary to map column names, providing more meaningful information. 
Additionally, I developed an algorithm to calculate the count of null values in each column. Using SQL, I employed various concepts like data aggregation, grouping, and ordering to solve the given problems and extract insights from the dataset.

By leveraging my Python and SQL skills, I successfully analyzed the environmental data and obtained valuable insights. 
I was able to determine the average temperature recorded for each device and identify devices where the temperature had increased from the minimum to the maximum recorded temperature.
Through this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in using Python and SQL for environmental data analysis. 

My attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and knowledge of these technologies enabled me to deliver accurate and meaningful results.
